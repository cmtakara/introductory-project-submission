		<h3> Hello and welcome. </h3>
		<p> I am in the process of figuring out exactly how to get to do the things that I really want to do as a job.  <br> </p>
		<p>	My background is varied.  In college, I majored in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.  
			Directly after college, I taught high school math for 3 years, followed by briefly working at the US Patent and Trademark Office. 	
			After that, I started working for a company that did work for NASA, and grew into a Systems Engineering role.  
			So, for about a decade, I worked on teams that developed, implemented, and maintained ground systems that communicate with satellites.
			<br> </p>
		<p>	Between moving from the DC area and Covid, I was presented with the opportunity to determine what fits best in my life now.
			I completed a graduate certificate in mathematics, which would allow me to teach at the community/junior college level.  
			However, I also miss the challenge that came with having a technical job.  In searching for a job that fits with what I would like to do, I came to the realization that I was pulled 
			too far away from the technical details, even though my job had oversight into software development.  
			<br> </p>
		<p id="focusParagraph">	Where I want to go from here...	<br> 
			One aspect of my former job that I really enjoyed was testing, and I would like to continue down that path.
			However, my prior testing experience was from a larger system level, and I want to be able to be more involved in software testing, including implementing automated test suites.
			Eventually, I want to be able to teach adults, probably math or computer science.
